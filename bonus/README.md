# Bonus material

Optional content for after the main four labs. Less polished than Labs 1-4 by design — these exist to give early finishers somewhere to go, and to seed the "as time allows" discussion at the end of the workshop.

## What's here

| | Type | Time | What it shows |
|--|------|------|---------------|
| [mcp/](mcp/) | Hands-on | ~15 min | Reimplement Lab 3's BGP tool as a Model Context Protocol server. Same capability, different boundary. |
| [rag/](rag/) | Hands-on | ~15 min | Replace Lab 2/3's hardcoded `BGP_REFERENCE` with a small vector store and retrieval over real network reference docs. |
| [anthropic/](anthropic/) | Mini-lab | ~5 min | Swap OpenAI for Anthropic Claude in any Lab 3/4 file. Two-line change. |
| [DISCUSSION.md](DISCUSSION.md) | Conversation | varies | Prompts for the end-of-workshop discussion: evals, production hardening, security, cost, multi-agent patterns. |

## A note on polish

The main labs are workshop-bulletproof. These bonus items are deliberately lighter: shorter READMEs, fewer guard-rails, more "here's the idea + code + try it." If something doesn't run cleanly on your environment, that's usually interesting — the failure modes here are part of the lesson.

Production-quality versions of all four topics are real software engineering work. What lives in this folder is the smallest viable demonstration that shows you the shape of each pattern.
